# Symptom Checker – Agent-Based Health Assistant

This solo project is inspired by the IRWA module structure and built using Python, Crew AI, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). It simulates a multi-agent system that classifies symptoms, matches conditions, and provides basic health advice.

## 🧠 Agent Architecture

- **Symptom Classifier Agent**  
  Parses user input and identifies relevant symptoms.

- **Condition Matcher Agent**  
  Maps symptoms to possible health conditions using rule-based logic or similarity scoring.

- **Advice Agent**  
  Suggests next steps based on matched conditions (e.g., rest, consult doctor, emergency).

- **Report Agent**  
  Formats the final output and enables download/export of the health report.

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- Python  
- Crew AI  
- RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)  
- Streamlit (for UI and download button)  
- AI Act documents (for testing RAG pipeline)

## 🎯 Goals

- Practice multi-agent orchestration using Crew AI  
- Apply RAG to real-world document retrieval  
- Build a clean UI with styled output and downloadable reports  
- Explore domain adaptation from risk analysis to healthcare

## 🚀 Status

Initial setup complete. Agent logic and UI integration in progress.

## 📁 Repo Notes

This project is a solo learning initiative and not part of any group submission. It builds on concepts from the IRWA module but explores a different domain for personal mastery.
