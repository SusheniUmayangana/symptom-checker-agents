# Symptom Checker â€“ Agent-Based Health Assistant

This solo project is inspired by the IRWA module structure. It uses agent-based architecture to classify symptoms, match conditions, and provide basic health advice.

## ðŸ§  Agents
- **Symptom Classifier Agent** â€“ Parses user input and identifies symptoms
- **Condition Matcher Agent** â€“ Maps symptoms to possible health conditions
- **Advice Agent** â€“ Suggests next steps (e.g., rest, consult doctor, emergency)

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals
- Practice agent-based design independently
- Explore UI styling and report export logic
- Showcase domain adaptation from risk analysis to healthcare

## ðŸš€ Status
Initial setup complete. Agent logic and UI integration in progress.
