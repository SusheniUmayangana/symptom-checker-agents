### Fever
Fever is a common symptom of viral infections. It may be accompanied by chills, sweating, and body aches. Recommended actions include rest, hydration, and paracetamol. Seek medical attention if the fever persists beyond 3 days or exceeds 102°F.

### Cough
Cough can result from respiratory infections, allergies, or irritants. Dry coughs may benefit from warm fluids and honey, while wet coughs may require expectorants. Persistent coughs should be evaluated by a healthcare provider.

### Headache
Headaches may be caused by stress, dehydration, or underlying conditions like migraines. Rest in a quiet, dark room and stay hydrated. Over-the-counter pain relief may help. Seek medical advice if headaches are frequent or severe.

### Sore Throat
A sore throat often indicates viral or bacterial infection. Gargling with warm salt water, staying hydrated, and using lozenges can provide relief. If accompanied by high fever or white patches, consult a doctor.

### Dengue
Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral illness marked by high fever, joint pain, rash, and fatigue. Avoid self-medication with NSAIDs. Seek immediate medical attention and maintain hydration. Monitor for warning signs like bleeding or abdominal pain.

### COVID-19
COVID-19 symptoms include fever, cough, loss of taste/smell, and fatigue. Isolate immediately, monitor oxygen levels, and consult a doctor if symptoms worsen. Follow local health guidelines and get tested.

### Cold
The common cold causes sneezing, nasal congestion, and mild fever. Rest, fluids, and steam inhalation help recovery. Avoid antibiotics unless prescribed for secondary infections.

### Migraine
Migraines are intense headaches often accompanied by nausea and sensitivity to light. Triggers include stress, certain foods, and hormonal changes. Rest, hydration, and prescribed medications can help manage symptoms.

### Diarrhea
Diarrhea may result from infections, food intolerance, or stress. Rehydration is critical — use oral rehydration salts (ORS). Avoid dairy and spicy foods. Seek medical help if symptoms persist or worsen.

### Skin Rash
Rashes can be caused by allergies, infections, or autoimmune conditions. Avoid scratching, use mild cleansers, and apply soothing creams. If rash spreads or is painful, consult a dermatologist.
